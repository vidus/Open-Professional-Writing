Open Professional Writing
---------------------------
Open Professional Writing is a historical archive of the Drupal-based course management system for 
writing classrooms that I created in graduate school. This project will likely never be updated, but is free for use. 

Open PW is the product of two years of development during my time administrating
the course sites for the Professional Writing program at Purdue University.  

This repository contains a full Drupal 7.xx installation and database for Open Professional Writing.  Included are the modules and custom themes to make the site work.  

Currently, an implementation of the site as a Features module is under development for Drupal 7.
