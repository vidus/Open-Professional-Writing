Open Professional Writing
---------------------------
Open Professional Writing is a Drupal-based course management system for 
writing classrooms.  The current build is based on Drupal 6, with Drupal 7
support coming in the next few weeks.

Open PW is the product of two years of development during my time administrating
the course sites for the Professional Writing program at Purdue University.  

This repository will contain the database files for this project and additionally the Drupal install current for that database, with custom themes included.

Unless you are confident in the ability of your mySQL and php settings, make use of the 
compressed versions of each database when uploading to mySQL.
